# COVID-Stocks-Relationship-Project
The focus of this project was to get data via an API key and explore the research questions of:
1. How are the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases affecting the stock market on a daily basis?
2. Does the increase in vaccinations reflect good news in the stock market?

An API key was found containing confirmed COVID cases and vaccinations administered across each state along with an API key that contained stock price data. With these datasets it was cleaned, analyzed relationships were found within the numbers that applied to the research questions above. Linear regression models were created and visualized to see the relationship between stock closing prices and vaccines adminstered as well as stock closing prices and COVID-19 cases. This project was performed in Python.
